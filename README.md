# resume
This is a small demo of http://resume_of_anqi.sonya.cc/ built using Python 3.9, FastAPI, and REST API. Currently, only the GET operation is implemented. <br/>
You can find the corresponding documentation at http://resume_of_anqi.sonya.cc/docs/, which is automatically generated by FastAPI.<br/>
If you clear the localStorage, the language displayed when you open the URL in the same browser will be the same as the last language set, with the default being English.
<br/>
You can use pip to install them (include uvicorn):<br/>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install uvicorn
```
Then you can run the server:<br/>
```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
