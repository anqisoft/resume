# resume
This is a small demo of http://resume_of_anqi.sonya.cc/ built using Python 3.9, FastAPI, and REST API. Currently, only the GET operation is implemented. 
You can find the corresponding documentation at http://resume_of_anqi.sonya.cc/docs/, which is automatically generated by FastAPI.
If you clear the localStorage, the language displayed when you open the URL in the same browser will be the same as the last language set, with the default being English.
